Hello everyone.

This is a set of percussion samples extracted from the Korg Pro-Wave
MIDI daughter board.
 
As with the earlier sample collections (proteus1, 2, 3 and 
Roland1, 2), my goal was to create some clean samples for use 
in making MODs, S3Ms, MTM's etc. 

This collection contains selected Percussion samples from both the 
standard and power set. 

Although the samples are in .wav format, they can be ported
to .smp, raw or almost any other using a program such as Goldwave.

Technical Specs:

All samples are 44.1kHz, 16 bit and were created by playing
different percussion notes on the Korg Pro-Wave DB, and capturing 
them live using a Creative Labs AWE-32. Post editing was done 
to optimize levels and remove the dead space.

This archive contains the following samples:
