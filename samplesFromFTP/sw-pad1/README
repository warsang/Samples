                       SET 1: KORG X5- Pads and Effects

SAMPLES TAKEN FROM:
Yamaha DX27
Roland D50
Korg X5

Samples recorded in Goldwave and made for Scream Tracker 3 in SND (raw)
format. No sample is over 64000 bytes, consequently. All samples are
recorded and squished to a rate of 11025 (most are recorded at a higher
initial rate).

(Well, there are exceptions to that <64K limit. See below.)

WARNING:
Samples are for non-commercial use only, being that they are samples of
PCM samples from other keyboards (excepting the DX27, which are FM
generated sounds). Commercial use of these samples is prohibited.

Feel free to email me about these samples, especially if you use them.
BTW, this is my first sample set. Comments are welcome!

My email address is:

Distribute these samples freely.
