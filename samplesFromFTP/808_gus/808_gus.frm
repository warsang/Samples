--DESCRIPTION-BEGIN------------------------------------------------------------
These aren't samples from a true 808, they're from the RB-338. They do,
however, sound REALLY close, are sampled at 44.1kHz/16bit, and sound a lot
better than any of the other 808 patch sets I've heard. You may want to adjust
the volumes a bit; they're all maximized. Included are kick, snare, clap, hihat
(open and closed), crash cymbal, cowbell, and maracas. Sorry if you wanted the
toms or congas or anything else, but I got lazy... Maybe I'll put those out
soon.
