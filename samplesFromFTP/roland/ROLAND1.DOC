Hello everyone.

This is the first hopefully of a series of samples extracted
from the Roland SCC-1 Sound Canvas MIDI synthesizer.
 
As with the earlier sample collections (proteus1, 2 and 3), 
my goal was to create some clean samples for use in making 
MODs, S3Ms, MTM's etc. 

This collection is only melodic instruments. I hope to sample
percussion instruments as well as more melodic ones in future
Roland sample collections.

Although the samples are in .wav format, they can be ported
to .smp or almost any other using a program such as Goldwave.

If there is a better way that I should capture them let me know.

Technical Specs:

All samples are 44.1kHz, 16 bit and were created by playing
different percussion notes on the Roland SCC-1, and capturing 
them live using a Turtle Beach Multisound. Post editing was done 
to optimize gain and remove the dead space.

This archive contains the following samples:
