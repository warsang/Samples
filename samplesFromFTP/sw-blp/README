            SET 2: KORG X5- Solos, bass, and more pads and effects

SAMPLES TAKEN FROM:
Yamaha DX27
Roland D50
Korg X5

Samples recorded in Goldwave and made for Scream Tracker 3 in SND (raw)
format. No sample is over 64000 bytes, consequently. All samples are
recorded and squished to a rate of 11025 (most are recorded at a higher
initial rate).

WARNING:
Samples are for non-commercial use only, being that they are samples of
PCM samples from other keyboards (excepting the DX27, which uses FM
sounds for samples). Commercial use of these samples is prohibited.

Feel free to email me about these samples, especially if you use them.

My email address is:
cgould@gate.net.

Distribute these samples freely.
