Hello everyone.

This is a complete replacement percussion patch set for the GUS 
extracted from the Roland SCC-1 Sound Canvas MIDI synthesizer.
 
This collection is only General MIDI percussion instruments. 
The patches employ the Gravis names for the coresponding factory
set. All that is needed is to directly replace your current percussion
.PAT files with this set. No chances to the .cfg file are necessary.


Technical Specs:

All patches are made from 44.1kHz, 16 bit samples. The samples were 
created by playing different percussion notes on the Roland SCC-1,
and capturing them live using a Turtle Beach Multisound. Post editing was 
done to optimize gain and remove the dead space. The samples also were
shortened as much as possible to conserve GUS memory. This meant that 
some samples were not allowed to "ring out" as much as I would have liked.

What follows is a listing of the contents of this archive. You need 
to save your original .pat files of the same name to a different 
directory and replace them with this IMHO much better set.
