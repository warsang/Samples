                  SET 4: KORG X5- Piano, Guitar, and Organ

SAMPLES TAKEN FROM:
Yamaha DX27
Roland D50
Korg X5

(Yeah, I'm behind. Forgive me.)

Samples recorded in Goldwave and made for Scream Tracker 3 in SND (raw)
format. No sample is over 64000 bytes, consequently. All samples are
recorded and squished to a rate of 11025 (most are recorded at a higher
initial rate).

(Actually, most of the samples in THIS pack are at 22050 Hz... better
quality for the piano stuff.)

WARNING:
Samples are for non-commercial use only, being that they are samples of
PCM samples from other keyboards (excepting the DX27, which uses FM
sounds for samples). Commercial use of these samples is prohibited.

Feel free to email me about these samples, especially if you use them.
Some of you have requested 44.1kHz samples (higher quality). I can
oblige with that; unfortunately, because I only have one lonely Gravis
Ultrasound card, I can't record 16 bit samples. However, you can get
ALMOST CD quality samples (44.1kHz 8 bit) if you email me and tell me
which samples you want.

My email address is:
cgould@gate.net.

Distribute these samples freely.
All of these patches are being uploaded to ftp.cdrom.com (check
