    SET 5: KORG X5- Brass, woodwinds, bells, percussion, and pad final

SAMPLES TAKEN FROM:
Yamaha DX27
Roland D50
Korg X5

Samples recorded in Goldwave and made for Scream Tracker 3 in SND (raw)
format. No sample is over 64000 bytes, consequently. All samples are
recorded and squished to a rate of 11025 (most are recorded at a higher
initial rate).

THERE HAS BEEN A FEW CHANGES since packs 1-4 was released. Firstly, by
popular demand, a full 44.1kHz sample pack with the best of packs 1-5
will be coming out with pack 5. Secondly, pack 6 is no longer the best
of General MIDI, but the custom patches that I recently loaded in the
X5. Also, the dates have been changed to better reflect my actual
delays.

WARNING:
Samples are for non-commercial use only, being that they are samples of
PCM samples from other keyboards (excepting the DX27, which uses FM
sounds for samples). Commercial use of these samples is prohibited.

My email address is:
cgould@gate.net.

Distribute these samples freely.
All of these patches are being uploaded to ftp.cdrom.com (check
/pub/demos/incoming/music or /pub/demos/music/samples for details)

Number of patches in set and release date are shown only as estimates.
