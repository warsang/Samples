Korg Polysix samples pack #2
By AstraDyne
----------------------------
The Polysix is a six voice analog synthezeiser built in 1981.
When it came out it was oftenly referred to as "the little brother"
of the Prophet 5.
This pack contains various sounds all sampled by me. The samples are free 
for non-comercial use but don't forget the credits :)......
Also, please tell me if you use my samples so that I can hear the music
you have created with them :)

The samples are not free for comercial use without my permission.
