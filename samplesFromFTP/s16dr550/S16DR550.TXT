                    THE SOUNDWAVE MUSIC SAMPLE COLLETION!
                             Samples for samplers
                         Big Series I - 44.1kHz 16 bit!
                          PART 7: BOSS DR-550 MKII PACK
                            Email: cgould@gate.net

This is yet another sample pack made for those with samplers and
high-end trackers. 50 samples are in this pack, all coming from the Boss
dr550mkII drum machine. It's a nice sample based drum machine with some
cool drum sounds. The samples were done on a Turtle Beach Tropez; hopefully
this provides a tad better audio quality than the Pro Audio Spectrum 16
(which in itself wasn't bad). Sorry, no loop points or envelopes are
provided.

Feel free to email me about these samples, especially if you use them.

My email address is:

Distribute these samples freely.

SOUNDS FROM THE BOSS DR-550MKII

All samples are simple attack hits - no multisamples or anything, set to
the default pitch and whatnot. The only exception is the last two, where
some effects processing took place.

All files are in the same zip! YAY! (:

No descriptions are provided; they are all percussion sounds. (: Snares,
basses, techno, industrial, rock, jazz, you name it... Enjoy.
