I made these samples using my Roland MC-202, with no effects.  These are
dry MC-202 sounds.  Add your own fx if you want.  All the samples are
standard WAV files sampled at 16bits and at 22050 Hz.

You are free to use these samples for non-commercial use.  If you want to use
the samples in a tune of yours, go right ahead, but I would appreciate it if
you told me or sent me the tune so I could hear it!  Also, please credit me
for the use of the samples.  Giving my MC-202 web address would be nice too
:)

If your song appears on an album or compilation....Then please ask my
permission to use the sample first....Sending me a copy of the album would be
nice too :)
