This time, every sample is unreleased!  Check it out :)

Notes on using the instruments
------------------------------
Crowd noises : Each crowd noise comes in a left and a right version
(that's actually not too accurate as the sound bounces around) ... to get a
really nice crowd effect, put them both on seperate tracks ... offset one of
them by 20 (O20) and there you have it!  Try also mixing the wildcrowd with
the normalcrowd.

Echo bass : When playing low notes, offset the sample so the timing is better.

Demosong : Listen to it, study it.

Note : To use with other trackers, rip out the samples.
