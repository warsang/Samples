Questions and Answers

Q: How do I use the samples if I don't have Impulse Tracker?
A: There are two ways to do this.  First, you could use a ripping
   program.  Second, you could load it up in ModPlug Player and save it
   in a format of your choosing.

Q: Why didn't you save it in XM?  Then we could all enjoy it!
A: For many reasons... these instruments are optimized for the IT format,
   meaning that they use cool things like NNA's and swings.  Also, I never
   learned how to use Fast Tracker 2.

Q: Do you hate FT2?
A: No, not at all.  I appreciate the technology of FT2, as well as the hard
   work that went into making it and the great musicians that use that
   editor.  In fact, IT might not have had some of its features if it
   weren't for FT2.

Q: What quality are these samples?
A: Most are 44khz, 16-bit, but a few are slightly lower quality.
