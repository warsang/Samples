 Hi there, NutCracker tapping the keys.  If you took the time to download
 this library then you are probably a musician, who has little or none of
 his own samples.  This library was meant for you, so read on!
 
 
 Copyright Notice
 ----------------

 All samples included in this library are free of charge, and you may use
 them in your own music.  All samples are of course (c) 1994, by GDR Metal
 Productions, and the Immortal Syndicate.  If you do use these instruments
 in your own library please credit us!
 

 Specs
 -----

 All samples were recorded off an M1, using a UltraSound MAX.  They are all
 16 bit 22.05KHz.

 Point of this Library
 ---------------------

 Well we had pushing requests from several individuals (Hi DNA!) to get
 some of our own samples out so others could use them.  So after a couple
 weeks (why so long?????) we were able to throw together a bunch of great
 sounding instruments.  We will probably release other sample libraries in
 the future including one from The Pope.  And maybe if we have some time
 we will throw in our own sample player, so you can test out the samples
 without having to load your own program.  For now we stayed simple.


 Using the samples in your music
 -------------------------------

 All samples in this library are in "WAV" format.  To convert them to the
 format your music editor uses we suggest using CONVERT 1.2b by Jesus 
 Villena.  It is the best convert program available!
