Hello everyone.

This is the third of a series of samples extracted
from the Turtle Beach Multisound Proteus 1/XR synthesizer.
Whereas the first and second collections (proteus1.zip and 
proteus2.zip) were a collection of melodic as well as 
percussion samples at 22kHz/16 bits, this one is percussion 
only at 44.1kHz/16 bits.

As with the first collections, my goal was to create some 
clean samples for use in making MODs, S3Ms, MTM's etc. 
Based on some good feedback (thanks Jester :-) I kept all 
samples very basic (no combos or riffs) for maximum 
usefulness. The quality is also better due to the fact 
that the sampling was done locally on the multisound
as opposed to using a seperate PC. This has yielded some 
very quiet and crisp samples compared to the first sets of
samples.

Although the samples are in .wav format, they can be ported
to .smp or almost any other using a program such as Goldwave.

If there is a better way that I should capture them let me know.

Technical Specs:

All samples are 44.1kHz, 16 bit and were created by playing
different percussion notes on the multisound, and capturing 
them live to RAM and then to disk. Post editing was done to 
optimize gain and remove the dead space.

Hope you find them useful.
