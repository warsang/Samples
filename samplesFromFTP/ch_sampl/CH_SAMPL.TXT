These samples are ripped from the cd : unreleased & revamped
They are the last 10/20 secs. of the numbers : 3,4,6

They are recorded on 22050 khz at 8 bits (mono)

Don't know if you may use them or not... (try it :)

Filenames work like this :


CH_(number of song)_(part).WAV

So , song 6 and part 3 would be :

CH_6_3.WAV

Allright?
