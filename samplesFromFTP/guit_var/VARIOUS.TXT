INFO FILE for the "Varied guitar pieces" samplepack by pOOgle and djzip
========================================================================

These guitar samples and loops were played by poogle and edited by djzip. Feel free to use them in your own songs as long as you give us some
credits :) Have fun. And please dont mails to us asking us to sample special samples for you. This pack was compiled really fast so dont send us any complaints :)

Also watch out for our Guitar chords samplepack which is available on HORNET and on www.da-funk.com.

Thank you..
