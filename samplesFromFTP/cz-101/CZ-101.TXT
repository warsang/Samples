About the synth
---------------
I got this synth about a month ago for about $100.  Dirt cheap, and very
common at that price too.  Go git one.

It's digital, 8 possible waveforms (saw, square, etc.. including three
rez-like waves).  Two oscillators, each with control for pitch,
wave, and amplitude in the form of 8 stage envelopes.

The wave envelope morphs between the basic wave and a sine wave.  This
sounds much like the closing of a lowpass filter.

Then there's the ring modulator - this really adds a lot of possible
strangeness.


About the samples
-----------------
They're raw, straight from the line out.  I suggest you postprocess them
in sound forge or a similar program.  

Many are poor quality, all are 8-bit. If you want them in higher quality, 
write to me.  I should be able to recreate the patch and sample it again
for you with little trouble.

I looped them, but the loop points were lost in conversion.  The end of
file is always the end of the loop I had.  Both forward and ping pong loops
were used.

If you want more, I'll probably be uploading another pack or two depending
on how productive I feel.
