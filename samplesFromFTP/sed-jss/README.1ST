Hi!

Juno Special Strings

Here you can see an instrument, created at 44.1 kHz, 16 bit and
multisampled to fit four octaves. You can use this instrument freely
anywhere. This was originally done by layering many different juno106
patches. Enjoy! Just sorry for not-so-good looping...

If you like this instrument, write me immediately! I will appreciate
your comments.
