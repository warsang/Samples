                            Email: cgould@gate.net

The Waldorf Pulse is a classy, 3-VCO analog bass synthesizer with some
nice acid-tweaking knobs if done right. It can do great Minimoog sounds,
screeching leads, and more.

I've made about 30 samples.

Feel free to email me about these samples, especially if you use them.

My email address is:
cgould@gate.net.

Distribute these samples freely.

Some are homemade, some are not, some are factory patches. Zip as usual
indicates which zip file it is in. Number indicates patch number (out of
100). Most are multisampled for that analog feel if you split up the
waveform. Lots of bass sounds - that's what the Pulse is good for. (:
