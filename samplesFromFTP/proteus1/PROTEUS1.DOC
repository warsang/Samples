Hello everyone.

This is the first (I hope) of a series of samples extracted
from the Turtle Beach Multisound Proteus 1/XR synthesizer.
My goal was to create some clean samples for use in making 
MODs, S3Ms, MTM's etc. If you find them useful, please let 
me know. If there is a better way that I should capture them
also let me know.

Technical Specs:

All samples are 22kHz, 16 bit most were created by playing a 
C3 note on one PC and capturing it live on another. Post editing
was done to equalize gain and remove the dead space. They are 
saved as .wav but can be changed using any one of many programs
out there. GoldWave comes to mind.

Hope you find them useful.
