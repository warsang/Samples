 Here are a bunch of samples from a X50.  I used my GUS MAX and Fast Tracker
 2.05 to record and edit all these samples.  Sorry for the terrible sound
 quality, apparently the sound source isn't good at all.  All samples are in
 .iff format, but you can use any sample converters to convert to desire
 format.  Most samples range from 70K - 200K, so I guess it's a pretty
 unfortunate for those S3M users out there.

 The sample pack(s) can be found on ftp.cdrom.com and or my homepage,
 http://www.csun.edu/~hbcsc386, so what out for more releases soon.

 If you wish to contact me for any reason, comment, suggestion, or whatever:
 I can be reach at --> hbcsc386@dewey.csun.edu (try primal@acid.org if the
 other has problem, with it usually does).

 signing off...
