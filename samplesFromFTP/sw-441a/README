       PACK 1A- SOME 44.1kHz SAMPLES!- The best 30 patches + 21 drums!

SAMPLES TAKEN FROM:
Yamaha DX27
Roland D50
Korg X5

44.1kHz sample pack! Recorded in .WAV format... These are optimized for
use in patches and FastTracker 2, as a result, only single notes have
been included (optimal for enveloping)...

THERE HAS BEEN A FEW CHANGES since packs 1-4 was released. Firstly, by
popular demand, a full 44.1kHz sample pack with the best of packs 1-5
will be coming out with pack 5. Secondly, pack 6 is no longer the best
of General MIDI, but the custom patches that I recently loaded in the
X5. Also, the dates have been changed to better reflect my actual
delays.

WARNING:
Samples are for non-commercial use only, being that they are samples of
PCM samples from other keyboards (excepting the DX27, which uses FM
sounds for samples). Commercial use of these samples is prohibited.

My email address is:
cgould@gate.net.

Distribute these samples freely.
All of these patches are being uploaded to ftp.cdrom.com (check
/pub/demos/incoming/music or /pub/demos/music/samples for details)

Number of patches in set and release date are shown only as estimates.
