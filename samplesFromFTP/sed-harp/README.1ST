Hi!

I'm presenting you these superb sounding chords played on harp. Please,
don't think I've used a real harp - I've just used some cool FT2 harp
instrument and a reverb with echo.

All I ask you is to send me a small feedback on these samples.
Please, do this. I just wanted to know if these samples sound real. Thanks!

(of course, if you want to know technology, I will surely tell it!)
