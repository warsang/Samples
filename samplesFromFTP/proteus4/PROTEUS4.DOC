Hello everyone.

This is the fourth and probably last in a series of samples 
extracted from the Turtle Beach Multisound Proteus 1/XR 
synthesizer. In this collection, I've tried to sample unique
sounds native only to the proteus synthesizer and that cannot 
be found in the General MIDI set. I'm hoping to provide the 
means for the many composers out there to make some truly
unique sounding mods.


As with the previous collections, my goal was to create some 
clean samples for use in making MODs, S3Ms, MTM's etc. 
I kept all samples very basic (no combos or riffs) for maximum 
usefulness. The quality is also better due to the fact 
that the sampling was done locally on the multisound
as opposed to using a seperate PC as was done on the first two
Proteus packs. This has yielded some very quiet and crisp samples.

Although the samples are in .wav format, they can be ported
to .smp or almost any other using a program such as Goldwave.


Technical Specs:

All samples are 44.1kHz, 16 bit mono and were created by playing
different notes on the multisound, and capturing them live to disk 
using the Multisound's own digital audio sampler. Post editing was 
done to optimize gain and remove the dead space as well as to keep 
the samples reasonable small.
