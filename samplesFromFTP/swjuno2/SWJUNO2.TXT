SAMPLES TAKEN FROM:
Roland Juno 106 - Analog-based synthesizer with thundering bass
Yamaha TX16W - Sampler with Typhoon OS; the modulation makes synthesis
               possible.

By popular demand, the Juno pack is back! And this time, we've got a lot
of resonance for all of you techno guys out there. (: We've got a couple
of samples of resonant acid-like bass, plus a lot of other goodies with
booms, distortion, LFOs, etc. There are 25 additional Juno sounds here,
recorded at 44.1kHz, 16 bit on a Pro Audio Spectrum 16 with the sample
point at C3 unless otherwise noted. Sorry, no loop points or envelopes
are provided. Sample notes are noted below each sample. Be sure to check
out the Typhoon TR-808-like kit as well.

Enjoy these samples. (:

Feel free to email me about these samples, especially if you use them.

My email address is:

Distribute these samples freely.
