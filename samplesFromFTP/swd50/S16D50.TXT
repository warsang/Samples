                    THE SOUNDWAVE MUSIC SAMPLE COLLETION!
                             Samples for samplers
                         Big Series I - 44.1kHz 16 bit!
                        PART 2 OF 4: ROLAND D-50 SAMPLES
                            Email: cgould@gate.net

SAMPLES TAKEN FROM:
Korg X5 - A classy little sample-based synthesizer.
Roland D50 - The king of the late 80s - LA synthesis and PCM samples
Yamaha DX27 - 4-op FM, the little cousin of the DX7
Roland Juno 106 - Analog-based synthesizer with thundering bass

This is the first sample pack made for those with samplers, not those
who simply are trackers. 100 samples are in this pack in total, 25 from
each keyboard (sorry, there's no room for more! You don't want the pack
to be THAT big, do you? (: ). All samples are default sampled at C3
unless noted in the text, and recorded at 44.1khZ, 16 bit on a Pro Audio
Spectrum 16. Some of these samples you won't find anywhere else, btw. (:
Sorry, no loop points or envelopes are provided. Sample notes are noted
below each sample.

I'm probably not going to do anymore "little" sample packs; these will
have to do, eh? (:

Feel free to email me about these samples, especially if you use them.

My email address is:
cgould@gate.net.

Distribute these samples freely.
