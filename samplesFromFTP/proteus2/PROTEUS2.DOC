Hello everyone.

This is the second of a series of samples extracted
from the Turtle Beach Multisound Proteus 1/XR synthesizer.
The first collection proteus1.zip was well received so here
are some more. The emphasis in this collection is on FX 
although some conventional samples are included.
As with the first collection, my goal was to create some 
clean samples for use in making MODs, S3Ms, MTM's etc. 
If you find them useful, please let me know. If there 
is a better way that I should capture them also let me know.

Technical Specs:

All samples are 22kHz, 16 bit most were created by playing a 
C3 note on one PC and capturing it live on another. Post editing
was done to equalize gain and remove the dead space. They are 
saved as .wav but can be changed using any one of many programs
out there such as GoldWave or Wave SE from Turtle Beach (the one 
that I use).

Hope you find them useful.
