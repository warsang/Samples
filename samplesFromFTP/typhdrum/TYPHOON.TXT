                            Email: cgould@gate.net

SAMPLES TAKEN FROM:
Roland Juno 106 - Analog-based synthesizer with thundering bass
Yamaha TX16W - Sampler with Typhoon OS; the modulation makes synthesis
               possible.

This is Typhoon's nice sounding TR-808 like kit uploaded at the
same time as the second Juno pack. Just completing your techno needs,
that's all. (:

Feel free to email me about these samples, especially if you use them.

Distribute these samples freely.

SOUNDS FROM THE YAMAHA TX16W:

These sounds were taken from the Yamaha TX16W sampler, using an
alternative OS called Typhoon. On the OS is a demo disk with a nice
808-style drum kit, made only by modulating primitive (sine, noise,
etc.) wave samples. Enjoy the pack. (:
