This is the text file that accompanied the original PROPHET.KRZ file, the file 
where these sounds come from.
----
Greetings :)
Enclosed in this zip are some prophet samples.
Most of them are multi samples; all were converted form other samples
available on the internet.

All of the programs (almost all anyway) use DS for Resonance and Foot Controller
for Envelope sweep -- on some programs, you wont get much of a sound (Fleudian
Trip for example) if the controllers arent set to a fun place.

Some of the setups and programs use layers from the contemporary rom; 
you might not here these layers; additionally a few setups didnt get saved with
some of the programs they use, so you'll miss out on "LA Grande" and a few other
contemp programs, but heck, add them or your favorite piano into the setup mixes :)

All of these samples were tuned by me, since they didnt convert with the tuning
offsets intact; I didnt use the best tuner in the world for this, so they may
be off by a cent or two -- you can fix it if you want.

Lastly, the keemaps 1BrsPhet, 2BrsPhet etc are variations of the same samples;
just testing out what sample ranges worked best.

Let me know what you think of these .. I have some Moog and TB basses I might upload
if theres interest..

To get these onto your machine, rename them as PROPHET.K25 and load them
in one at a time...If you have a K2000 you'll need the latest OS to read them.
Peace,
