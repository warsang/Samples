Fleudian.wav & proph_c?.wav are K2K samples that have went through the 
Kurzweil's synthesis engine. The rest are raw Prophet samples (no effects, no 
filters, nothing).

Fleudian.wav is an excellent example of what can be done with a simple sample 
and the Kurzweil's fantastic V.A.S.T. synthesis engine. And I didn't even touch 
the modwheel or the data-slider yet!... (Imagine the possibilities!...)
