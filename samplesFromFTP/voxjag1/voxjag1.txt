VOX JAGUAR ORGAN
4.1 khz 16 bit
.wav format

These are from a late '60's organ- The Vox Jaguar.. which I'm borrowing
from a very kind friend.  The samples could be of better quality but
the organ's keys play at a very low level so I did my best to correct
this and take out the noise in Sound Forge.  They turned out better
than I thought they would.

There are seven .wav files, some in stereo, sampled at C1, F1, B1,
C2, G#2, C3, and G#3 with the first octave being the
bass samples (white keys =) of the organ. I would have sampled
the high octave but unfortunately it's screwed up and plays
the same octave as the one above it.

Enjoy these.. this organ's a classic.
Give back to the sampling community by making your own sets. =)
